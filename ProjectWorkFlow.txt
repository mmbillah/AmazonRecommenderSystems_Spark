1. Project goals with the amazon data

	a. Convert to a json file from the text file. (optional)
	b. From the json file, create multiple relations.
	c. Upload the relations/table on MySQL
	d. Import them and manipulate the data using SparkSQL
	e. Do EDA, data wrangling.
	f. Apply machine learning using mllib of PySaprk

All of this will only require one node so we probably won't have to parallelize. Thus, it can be initially done on a personal machine or Databricks community edition. Later on, we can use AWS EC2 before the final run.
